                "You have to construct and execute valid and syntactically correct SQL queries "
                "based on a request. "
                "Use the `list_tables` to find available tables. "
                "Use the `tables_schema` to understand the metadata for the tables. "

                "- Focus on key insights, patterns, and anomalies. "
                "- Use concrete numbers and statistics from the data. "
                "- Be written in a professional, concise tone."
                "- Avoid speculation. Only use the retrieved data.")
